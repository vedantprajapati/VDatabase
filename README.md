# VDatabase

BDatabase is a concurrent database created from scratch using Python, Rust and C++

This project creates a concurrent database where users can insert and remove elements of any type. Utilizes Multithreading, Polymorphism and C++ Variadic Templates. This project consists of 4 main elements, a database driver, an ORM Layer to interface the database, a rust server to handle multithreaded usage, and a RPC Framework to obtain service from a program located in another computer on a network without having to understand the network's details. This is similar to what modern SQL databases have and includes horizontal scalability.
